# AI-Habitat-Mapping-
This Model is medium accuracy AI Model for habitat mapping 

## supported datasets
this project natively supports followinf datasets in YOLOv8 format
1. [FLAIR Challenge](https://ignf.github.io/FLAIR/)

## file-info
* you can find all noebooks used in notebooks folder
* predict.py - can predict the areas of interest in a image with a trained model
* train.py - can be used to train a new model (literally train any YOLOv8 model with right config file)

you can find a working example of the work [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mohotta/HabitatMapping)
